## The ESA CIMR DEVALGO study

This page is the entry-point for the Level-2 ATBDs (Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document) produced by the ESA CIMR DEVALGO study.

The CIMR DEVALGO study is a 2-year ESA-funded study (2022-2024) funded to develop prototype ATBDs for a selection of CIMR Level-2 products.

The Level-2 ATBDs developed by the CIMR DEVALGO study, sorted by Level-2 Product families, are:
* Polar Regions and Adjacent Seas:
   * Level-2 Sea Ice Concentration, Sea Ice Edge, and SIC in NRT1H 
   * Level-2 Sea Ice Drift [v1](https://cimr-algos.github.io/SeaIceDrift_ATBD/intro.html)
   * Level-2 Sea Ice Thickness 
   * Level-2 Sea Surface Temperature 
   * Level-2 Sea Surface Salinity 
   * Level-2 Ocean Wind Vectors 
* Global Land:
   * Terrestrial Snow Area 

In addition, an [Ocean and Sea Ice Integrated Retrieval ATBD v1]() is developed.

CIMR is the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer mission, a multi-frequency, conically-scanning passive microwave imager
designed by ESA to support EU's Arctic Policy, among others. Its launch is scheduled in 2029.
